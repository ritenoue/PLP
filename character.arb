#roll dice for strength, intelligence, charisma
    #These are basically the same functions, however they also explain the function of these scores. 
    #So I feel that they should stay separate.
#get advantages/disadvantages:
    #I chose to write the function for each stat because they will be used in different scenarios. I felt it was simpler this way
    #I am not sure I need both the charisma and intelligence stats.
